# Werkzeuge
My Tools Repo - Small monorepo for my small utility programs.
It is setup as a cargo workspace to facilitate CI and sharing between crates.
See Cargo.toml description for each project to see what it is about or if it's a bit more complicated I'll try to add a readme in the project folder.

If you want to install a tool after cloning the repo navigate to the tools folder and use `cargo install --path .`

## License

All code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

- Apache License, Version 2.0
- MIT license

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are very good reasons to include both as noted in
this [issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) on [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org)'s repo.

### Contribution

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted
